# Hiker-React-Native
This is a hiking trip management app that I built based on React Native. This app has two main functions:

a) Enter details of hikes: 
Name of hike (e.g. "Snowdon•, "Trosley Country park", etc.) — Required field 
Location - Required field 
Date of the hike - Required field 
Parking available (i.e. "Yes" or "NO") - Required field 
Length the hike - Required field 
Level of difficulty - Required field 
Description — Optional field 

b) Store, view and delete hike details or reset the database 
All the details entered by the user should initially be stored on the device in an SQLite database. 
The user should be able to list all the details of all hikes that have been entered into the app, edit or 
delete individual hikes and delete all the details from the database.
